      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted a fast, simple way to get this blog up and running. I also wanted to learn how I can host a site on GitHub since I 1) knew it was possible and 2) had never gotten the chance to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo-vs-jekyll-and-github-pages&#34;&gt;Hugo vs. Jekyll and GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I read, Jeykll is the native, go-to option for hosting static sites on GitHub Pages. I opted for Hugo instead because it would be less automated and force me to get familiar with using git locally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;an-old-dog-learning-new-tricks&#34;&gt;An Old Dog Learning New Tricks&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I resigned myself to never being a &amp;ldquo;computer person.&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t technology averse, but I had attempted to learn how to code on my own a couple times with no success. I assumed my brain &amp;ldquo;just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way.&amp;rdquo; But at a certain point, an unfinished history and english degree wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking like the key to wealth, so I reevaluated my options. It was 2022, and a Computer Science degree was talked about as a golden ticket to high-earning careers. With nothing else going for me, I figured it couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to give it one more (serious) try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
