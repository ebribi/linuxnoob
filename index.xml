      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I resigned myself to never being a &amp;ldquo;computer person.&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t technology averse, but I had attempted to learn how to code on my own a couple times with no success. I assumed my brain &amp;ldquo;just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way.&amp;rdquo; But at a certain point, an unfinished history and english degree wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking like the key to wealth, so I reevaluated my options. It was 2022, and a Computer Science degree was talked about as a golden ticket to high-earning careers. With nothing else going for me, I figured it couldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to give it one more (serious) try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
